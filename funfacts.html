      <div class="containerff">
      <div> <b> BLOOD BANK </b></div>
      <p>  In 1937, Chicago became the first city to establish a blood bank in the United States. Blood banks allowed doctors to store and examine donated blood – an important and lifesaving development for medicine. Hospitals around the States opened their own blood banks soon after. </p>

  <div class="containerff">
   <div> <b>OPEN-HEART SURGERY</b></div> 
    <p> Daniel Hale Williams was one of the first black physicians in the city. By 1883, he graduated with a degree in medicine from Northwestern University. He performed the nation’s first open-heart surgery in Chicago at Provident Hospital in 1893. Thanks to Dr. Williams’ operation, the recipient of the surgery, a man who was stabbed close to the heart, was able to fully recover in two months. </p>

  <div class="containerff">
    <div> <b>SPRAY PAINT </b></div> 
    <p> Where did the idea of putting paint in a can with a spray tip come from? Chicago paint salesman Ed Seymour actually invented this artistic substance, which is now used to create colorful works in public spaces all over the city.</p>

    <div> <b> TWINKIE </b></div>
    <p> Chicagoan Jimmy Dewar worked as a manager at the famed Hostess Brands factory. During that time, Dewar wanted to create a pastry that was filled with cream. His invention, the Twinkie, launched in 1930. The original Twinkie was filled with banana cream, but was replaced with vanilla cream during WWII when bananas became scarce. </p>

    <div> <b> ALL-COLOUR TELEVISION STATION </b></div>
    <p> Chicago’s own NBC 5 Chicago/WMAQ television station has a rich history of innovation. After many months of hard work, the channel became the first all-color station in the world on April 15, 1956. Later, the station became the city’s first commercial station to broadcast in stereo in September 1986. </p>

  <div class="containerff">
    <div> <b> TELEVISED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE </b></div>
    <P> This innovation in television transformed voting by letting citizens witness important political matters in the comfort of their own homes. The presidential candidates’ debate between John Fitzgerald Kennedy and Richard Milhous Nixon was the first to be broadcast on television from Chicago’s CBS channel on September 26, 1960. This political breakthrough made it easier for citizens to feel updated and included.</P>

    <h2> <b> Intriguing fact:</b> </h2>
      <div><i>The Chicago River flows backward!</i></div>
       <p> Flowing through downtown Chicago, the Chicago River has a fascinating history. Not only does this river run through various systems and canals, but it is also the only river in the world that flows backward. A reversal technique was introduced for sanitation reasons to divert the sewage away from Lake Michigan’s water supply. The reversal of the river was recognized as being the largest public earth-moving project ever completed. It was also acknowledged as a great engineering achievement. </p>
