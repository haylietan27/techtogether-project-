    <div><h2 class="subhead"><b>THE CHICAGO HOT DOG </b></h2> </div> 
      <p> The Chicago-style hot dog was born out of the Great Depression and is almost as — if not just as — closely associated with the Windy City as deep-dish pizza.
  
  If you order it “all the way” or “dragged through the garden,” your Chicago dog will be made with steamed, all-beef franks, topped with mustard, neon green relish, onions, sport peppers, sliced tomato, pickle spears, and celery salt, served on a steamed poppy seed bun.
  
  You’ll find Chicago-style hot dogs at restaurants and street vendors across the city, as well as on the menu of hot dog eateries all over the United States. Chicago even has an annual Hot Dog Fest to celebrate the staple.</p>

    <div><h2 class="subhead"><b>BROWNIES</b></h2> </div>
      <p> Did you know brownies were created right here in the Windy City? It’s true! During the 1893 World’s Fair, Chicago socialite Bertha Palmer asked the pastry chef at The Palmer House to create her something that would fit neatly into boxed lunches for the Women’s Pavilion. It was then that the beloved American dessert was born. 
        Although it wasn’t immediately given the name “brownie,” the baked treat was an instant hit. The original recipe used semi-sweet chocolate, walnuts, and an apricot glaze.</p>
      <p> The first-known printed use of the word "brownie" to describe a dessert appeared in the 1896 version of the Boston Cooking-School Cook Book by Fannie Farmer, in reference to molasses cakes baked individually in tin molds.</p>

    <p> The Italian beef, a sandwich featuring thinly sliced roast beef simmered in a broth (known locally as "gravy") containing Italian-style seasonings and served on an Italian roll soaked in the meat juices.

Italian beef sandwiches are traditionally topped with sweet peppers or spicy giardiniera. You can find Italian beef sandwiches in dozens of restaurants and food vendors all across the Windy City.</p>
