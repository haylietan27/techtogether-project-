        <img src="images/bean.png" alt="cloudgate" width="200" height="160"> 
      <p> Cloud Gate is a public sculpture by Indian-born British artist Anish Kapoor, that is the centerpiece of AT&T Plaza at Millennium Park in the Loop community area of Chicago, Illinois.  Constructed between 2004 and 2006, the sculpture is nicknamed "the Bean" because of its shape, a name Kapoor initially disliked, but later grew fond of.  Kapoor`s design was inspired by liquid mercury and the sculpture's surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline.  The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes, and it is popular with tourists as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.</p>
